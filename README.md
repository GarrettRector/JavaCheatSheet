Cheat Sheet
=============================

Java Cheat Sheet is just a bunch of Java syntax/examples

# Java Information

Java is a [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) Language 
(Object Orientated Programming), which means the language is based off [objects](#objects). 
These objects can be [Variables](#variables), [Methods](#methods), a million other things.
Data types are also a big part of Java as well as every other programming language, which are
[Primitive data types]() and [Non-Primitive data types](), which happen to be the two main 

# Syntax

A lot of IDEs will cover Basic syntax, but I will cover a lot of it here:
* Any Phrase in Java will require a semicolon (;) after it
* Unlike Python, [Methods](#methods) use Curly Brackets {}, instead of colons (:)
    ```java
    public class Methods {
    public void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java Examples");
    }
* [Classifiers](#classifiers) are used for both methods and for variables, and are required for Java.
* For 

# Variables
To Do

# Methods
Methods are a part of java that allows you to run multiple pieces of code at once, and require

# Classifiers
To Do

# Objects
Objects composed of [Primitive data types](#primitive-data-types) and [Non-Primitive data types](#non-primitive-data-types)
and can be used to describe everything in Java because it is a OOP language, and is focused on Objects.

#Primitive Data Types

#Non-Primitive Data Types
