Cheat Sheet
=============================

Java Cheat Sheet is just a bunch of Java syntax/examples

# Java Information

Java is a [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) Language (Object Orientated Programming), which means the language is based off objects. These objects can be [Variables](#variables) or they can be [Methods](#methods)

# Syntax

A lot of IDEs will cover Basic syntax, but I will cover a lot of it here:
* Any Phrase in Java will require a semicolon (;) after it
* Unlike Python, [Methods](#Methods) use Curly Brackets

# Variables
Hello

# Methods
Hello
